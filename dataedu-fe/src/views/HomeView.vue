            <p>
              In this website, you will find contents, tutorials and online tools that I use in my day-to-day tasks as a
              data engineer.

              The primary reason of this site is to publish tools that helps me to understand, practice, or even develop
              proof of concepts for my projects. There would be small tutorials and links to sources if you'd like to
              learn
              more.
